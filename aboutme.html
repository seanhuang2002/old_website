					<article class="item">
						<i class="fas fa-laptop-code fa-3x"></i>
						<h3><br>Technology</h3>
						<p>My fascination with technology began when I was first exposed to the online YouTube videos
							where people would document how they built their own custom computers, with all the physical components
							and the digital software. My love for all things tech has only grown since I participated in various robotics 
							and computer science classes where I learnt how to program Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots and how to write code in Java.
						</p>

						<i class="fas fa-plane-departure fa-3x"></i>
						<h3><br>Aviation</h3>
						<p>What always puzzled me as a child was trying to get my mind around how something as massive as a jumbo jet
							could gracefully and safely fly through what I thought was nothing without falling right back down to the ground. While my
							appreciation for aviation simmered while I learnt in school about the physics of aviation, my real passion aerospace was ignited
							after I joined the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, where I learnt almost all there was to learn about flying and piloting planes. I even got 
							the once in a lifetime opportunity to fly in the cockpit of the Prime Minister's CC-150 Polaris on take off, an experience which
							I will never forget. 
						</p>

						<i class="fas fa-book fa-3x"></i>
						<h3><br>History</h3>
						<p>Reading about the history of the world has always been one of my hobbies growing up. To know how the humans of yesteryear
							behaves is something which, like technology, fascinates me. In fact, while it had only been a hobby for the longest time, I decided to pursue
							higher level History in the IBDP, a very academically rigourous course to choose. I even wrote my Extended Essay, a required portion of the IB
							Diploma which involves the drafting of a 4000 word independently researched essay, on my favourite topic in history, the Early Modern period of
							East Asia.

						<i class="fas fa-vote-yea fa-3x"></i>
						<h3><br>Politics</h3>
						<p>Politics in a representative democracy has always been something that interested me. Learning about different political systems throughout human history
							has led me to garner a great respect and appreciation for Western liberal representative democracy, whether that be throught our own Canadian system of consitutional
							monarchy and Westminster-style parliamentarism, American style presidential republicanism, or German parliamentary republicanism. I love to write on politics too, check
							out my blog!

						<h3><br>Culinary Arts</h3>
						<p>Stemming from my consumption of the intense Gordon Ramsay, to the chill wibes of the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen, 
							I can definitely say that I love food! I like eating it(quite obviously), but I especially love making it. From baking to braising, I'm always motivated to try new foods and 
							try their recipes at home. Whenever I try a new recipe, I post on my blog, check it out!
						</p>

						<i class="fas fa-user-ninja fa-3x"></i>
						<h3><br>Asian Culture</h3>
						<p>My ancestry is an integral part of my identity. I have a great love of East Asian culture, from Chinese to Japanese, from Korean to Taiwanese, I love it all!
							As I pursue my studies, my hope is to be able to get more in tune with the culture of my ancestors, perhaps even learning a new language.
