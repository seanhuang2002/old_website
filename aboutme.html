                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Sean Huang and I am a 17 year old Computer Science Major at the University of Waterloo in
                    the
                    Faculty of Mathematics. I was born and raised in Toronto and I have a passion for computer science,
                    history,
                    politics and aviation. I am a graduate of the Toronto French School's International Baccalaureate
                    Diploma Programme
                    with an Advanced Bilingual Diploma.

                <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Through the various computer science courses I have taken and the various computer science related
                    programmes I have attended, I have gained a wide variety of skills such as an intimate knowledge of
                    Java and
                    its application framework JavaFX, SQL and an elemental grasp of HTML and XML. I also know how to
                    utilize blockchain
                    technology in various applications.

    <div id="MyBackground">
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in computer science and topics related to technology. Much of this was
            gained during
            my primary and secondary education. Most of my schooling occured at the Toronto French
            School, a renowned and well
            respected French independent school in Northern Toronto. I participated in the rigourous
            International Baccalaureate Diploma programme
            where I took Chemistry, English Literature and History in the higher level, along with Physics,
            Mathematics and French in
            standard level.
            In addition to the rigourous IBDP, I opted to enroll in an optional Computer Science course, where I
            gained all my knowledge in
            computer science and programming. I have participated in the University of Waterloo's Canadian
            Computing Contest at both the Junior
            and Senior levels.

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
            I have a great passion about computer science and technology, its why I'm currently studying it!<br>One of
            my goals is, quite simply, to
            learn more about how these complex machines, and the software they run, function.<br><br>While my primary
            interest is in the software side of computers,
            the hardware side hasn't failed to rub off on me either! I'va always loved to deconstruct computers and
            examine closely how their various components
            and parts work together harmoniously to produce the incredible machines we use day to day.
        </p>
        <h3>My Other Interests</h3>
        <p>
            While tech is one of my greatest passions, I have not neglected other fields which interest me.
        </p>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    History and politics have both been interests which have competed for command of my future with
                    technology. I absolutely love reading
                    and learning about the history of our world and its diverse cultures.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <h3>Aviation</h3>
                <p>
                    Stemming from my participation in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, I have gained now a renewed
                    appreciation for civilian aviation and the Armed Forces in general.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <h3>Asian Cultures</h3>
                <p>
                    Being a first generation Chinese-Canadian, I have always held the culture of my ancestors in high
                    regard. With out globalized world, not only is that Chinese culture,
                    but also Japanese culture and Korean culture. In fact, I even plan on pursuing a Minor in Japanese
                    while at the University of Waterloo.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <h3>Politics</h3>
                <p>
                    Politics too is something that I enjoy, with its lively debates on governing philosophies and
                    different political systems and norms. I have been involved in many politic
                    activities in the past, such as campaigning for various Conservative Parties.
