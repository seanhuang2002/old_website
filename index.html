    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Sean Huang, and welcome my personal website, currently being hosted on GitHub Pages.<br><br>
      I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo, studying Honours Computer Science co-op, and 
      I plan on graduating in the class of 2025. <br><br> Below you will find links to my various social media pages:

    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Through the various computer science courses I have taken and the various computer science related programmes
      I have attended, I have gained a wide variety of skills such as an intimate knowledge of Java and its application
      framework JavaFX, SQL and an elemental grasp of HTML and XML. I also know how to utiliza blockchain technology in various applications.

  <div id="MyBackground">
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in computer science and topics related to technology. Much of this was gained during
      my primary and secondary education. <br><br> Most of my schooling occured at the Toronto French School, a renowned and well
      respected French independent school in Northern Toronto. I participated in the rigourous International Baccalaureate Diploma programme
      where I took Chemistry, English Literature and History in the higher level, along with Physics, Mathematics and French in 
      standard level.<br><br>
      In addition to the rigourous IBDP, I opted to enroll in an optional Computer Science course, where I gained all my knowledge in
      computer science and programming. I have participated in the University of Waterloo's Canadian Computing Contest at both the Junior
      and Senior levels.

  <div id="MyInterests">
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>
      I have a great passion about computer science and technology, its why I'm currently studying it!<br>One of my goals is, quite simply, to 
      learn more about how these complex machines, and the software they run, function.<br><br>While my primary interest is in the software side of computers,
      the hardware side hasn't failed to rub off on me either! I'va always loved to deconstruct computers and examine closely how their various components
      and parts work together harmoniously to produce the incredible machines we use day to day.
    </p>
    <h3>My Other Interests</h3>
    <p>
      While tech is one of my greatest passions, I have not neglected other fields which interest me.
    </p>
    <h4>History and Politics</h4>
    <p>
      History and politics have both been interests which have competed for command of my future with technology. I absolutely love reading
      and learning about the history of our world and its diverse cultures. Politics too is something that I enjoy, with its lively debates on 
      governing philosophies and different political systems and norms. 
    </p>
    <h3>Aviation</h3>
    <p>
      Stemming from my participation in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, I have gained now a renewed appreciation for civilian aviation and the Armed Forces in general. 
    </p>
    <h3>Asian Cultures</h3>
    <p>
      Being a first generation Chinese-Canadian, I have always held the culture of my ancestors in high regard. With out globalized world, not only is that Chinese culture, 
      but also Japanese culture and Korean culture. In fact, I even plan on pursuing a Minor in Japanese while at the University of Waterloo.
